# ShadowLoad
This repository contains artifacts for the paper "ShadowLoad: Injecting State into Hardware Prefetchers" ([dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3676641.3716020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3676641.3716020)).
In the paper we present `StrideRE`, a tool to automatically infer properties of hardware stride prefetchers.
Additionally, we describe two primitives called `ShadowLoad` and `FetchProbe` that are available on a wide range of Intel and AMD processors.
For instructions on how to evaluate the artifacts please refer to the [artifact appendix](ArtifactAppendix.pdf) of the paper.
